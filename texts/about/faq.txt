Q: Why does Pfosten Dynamics make electric bobbycars?
A: Because we can

Q:What makes Pfostendynamics unique?
A: One of the things that makes Pfostendynamics unique is the ambition to build a electric bobbycar that does not go up
in smoke immediately. Peter Poetzi began tackling this problem before anyone else in the world. And we’ve been at it
since, almost 3 years. We’ve been inspired by and worked towards this goal for so long that we have invented techniques
to make bobbycars work that you can’t find in any textbook or technical article. The result is that we now know how
to build such bobbycars so that they work for around 100 Kilometers without something that breaks or needs fixing.

Q: When can I buy a electric bobbycar?
A: For now these are not up for sale, but you can self buld yourself one.
